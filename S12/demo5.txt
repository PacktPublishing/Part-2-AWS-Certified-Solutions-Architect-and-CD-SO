Objective: Expose microservices/container from well defined end points
using Application Load Balancer

Applications/Consumers talk to ALB using port 80 or 443 or other well defined static
ports.

Internally, load balancer distributes the traffic across container instances that are
exposed through ephimeral ports.  ALB takes care of instance:port tracking.

In this example, we are going to create a Service under a cluster. Service
is intended for long running tasks.

1. Create an ALB "ALBDemo"
2. SG - Pick LoadBalancerSG
3. Define a Target Group TargetGroupDemo
4. Specify Protocol as HTTP and Port as 80.  What this really means is that
forward the requests from ALB to registered hosts in the target group at port 80. However,
with containers, it has a slightly different meaning. It says forward the requests to 
registered containers to container port 80.
5. Change healthy threshold to 2.
6. Dont register any targets yet
7. Create ALB

Grant Service Role

1. Create Service "ServiceDemo"
2. In task definition, pick version 2 of the taskDemo 
3. Select "ECSDemo" Cluster.  We are going to run our tasks in the ECSDemo cluster
4. Number of tasks - specify 1 for now
Min health percent
Maximum Percent

5. Under Optional Configuration
    Select "Configure ELB"
    Select the ALBDemo
    Select the helloworldContainer:0:80 to ELB
    Pick LB Listener port as 80
    Select "Create new target group"
    Pick the targetgroup "TargetGroupDemo"
    Path Pattern "/"
    Save
6. Create Service
